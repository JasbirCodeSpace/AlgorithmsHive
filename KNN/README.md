# K-Nearest Neighbours

KNN is a non-parametric, lazy learning algorithm. Its purpose is to use a database in which the data points are separated into several classes to predict the classification of a new sample point.

> The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, similar things are near to each other.

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
